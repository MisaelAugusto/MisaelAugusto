### Hi, I am Misael Augusto
<main id="description">
  <p align="justify">
    I was born in the city of Campina Grande, in the state of Paraíba.<br/>
    Today I am 20 and I am a student of Computer Science at Federal<br/>
    University of Campina Grande.
  </p>
  <p>
    I&apos;ve always been passionate about technology and all the<br/>
    possibilities it offers us to create solutions to our society&apos;s<br/>
    problems! I realy want to work with projects that have positive<br/>
    impact in the people's daily lives and improve their lives even<br/>
    if it&apos;s in a subtle way.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently studying web and mobile development. My main<br/>
    objective at the moment is to become a software engineer in any<br/>
    of these areas. In addition, in my spare time, I also try to put<br/>
    my creativity into practice by developing some simple logic games.
